# Spec: `chunk_document()`

**File:** `ingest.py`
**Status:** Pre-implemented — read through this spec and the code in `ingest.py` before moving to Milestone 2.

---

## Purpose

Split a single rule book document into smaller chunks suitable for embedding and semantic retrieval. Each chunk should carry enough context to be meaningful on its own when retrieved in response to a user query.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter   | Type  | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`      | `str` | The full text of a rule book document                           |
| `game_name` | `str` | The name of the game this document belongs to (e.g., `"Catan"`) |

**Output:** `list[dict]`

Each dict in the returned list contains exactly these keys:

| Key          | Type  | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"text"`     | `str` | The chunk text                                                      |
| `"game"`     | `str` | The game name (passed through from `game_name`)                     |
| `"chunk_id"` | `str` | A unique identifier for this chunk (e.g., `"catan_0"`, `"catan_1"`) |

Returns an empty list `[]` if the input text is empty or produces no valid chunks.

## Design Decisions

---

### Splitting approach

```
Character-based sliding window. The document text is stepped through in
fixed-size windows of `chunk_size` characters, advancing by
(chunk_size - overlap) on each step so adjacent chunks share a small
region of text at their boundary.
```

---

### Chunk size

```
300 characters. Rule book text is semantically dense — a single rule is
often 1–3 sentences, which fits comfortably in this range. Going smaller
would fragment individual rules; going larger would merge unrelated rules
into one chunk, making retrieval less precise.
```

---

### Overlap

```
50 characters of overlap between adjacent chunks. If a rule falls exactly
on a chunk boundary, neither chunk alone contains the full rule. Overlap
duplicates the tail of each chunk at the start of the next, so boundary-
spanning content can still be retrieved intact. 50 characters is roughly
one short sentence — enough to preserve context without significantly
bloating the database.
```

---

### Minimum chunk length

```
50 characters. Chunks shorter than this are discarded. Very short segments
typically contain only whitespace, section headers, or punctuation — content
that has no semantic signal and would just add noise to the vector database.
```

---

### Rationale

```
Rule books pack a lot of meaning into short passages, so smaller chunks
tend to outperform paragraph-level splitting for targeted Q&A. A 300-
character window is typically one complete rule — the right unit of
retrieval for questions like "What happens when you roll a 7?" Paragraph
splitting would work but produces uneven chunk sizes, since rule book
paragraphs vary from one sentence to ten.
```

---

### Known limitations

```
Character-based splitting is indifferent to sentence and paragraph
boundaries. A chunk can begin mid-sentence or split a rule across two
chunks even with overlap, if the rule is longer than `chunk_size`.
Numbered lists (e.g., "1. ... 2. ... 3. ...") may get split in the
middle of an item. A paragraph-aware or sentence-aware splitter would
handle these cases better, at the cost of more implementation complexity.
```

## Implementation Notes

_Fill this in after running the app and confirming ingestion worked._

**Actual chunk count produced across all 8 rule books:**

```
My terminal tells me that after loading 8 rule documents, it stored 149 total
chunks in the vector database.
```

**One thing that surprised you or didn't match your expectations:**

```
I don't know if it's fair to say, but I didn't necesarily have too many expectations.
I guess when I read rule books, I don't think of them being TOO long so the number
of chunks maybe sounds bigger than I thought, but that's about it. Also, I'm kinda curious what 300 characters looks like. In a way it sounds like a lot because it is 300, but I am curious about how long the average rule is in certain rulebooks.
```
